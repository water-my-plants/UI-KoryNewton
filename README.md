# Water My Plants

Water My Plants is a web application for keeping track of your plants water needs.

Upon signing up inside the application, users are able to add, remove and edit plants on their list. Users will be asked for a name for each plant and they may choose to add an optional description and location of the plant. Once the plant has been added the user can click on the edit button of a specific plant to add a watering schedule. Once a schedule has been added, the user will recieve a text notification using the mobile number used upon signing up when it is time to water their plants.

The frontend of the application was built using React, the backend was built using Node/Express and is deployed on Heroku. The marketing/front page was built with HTML, CSS and LESS.
